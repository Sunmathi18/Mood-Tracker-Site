Project Title: Mood-Tracker-Site

Web page using HTML , CSS, JavaScript which detects the mood of the user by selecting a emoji.

Mood‑Popup 😊
A simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that detects a user's mood (via emoji selection) and displays a customized popup message with an overlay and close button.

🚀 Features

Emoji‑based mood selector – Users pick an emoji (e.g., 😄, 😢, 😠).
Overlay screen – Darkens background before popup appears.
Popup message – Shows customized message based on mood.
Close button – Dismisses the popup and returns to the main view.

💡 Demo

A screenshot has also been uploaded.

🧩 How It Works

User clicks an emoji button (HTML <button>/<img>).
JavaScript detects the selected emoji and matches it to a message in a lookup object.
Overlay & popup elements are made visible (via CSS classes or inline styles).
Close button hides overlay and popup, resetting the view.
